# ISP

> The Image and Signal Processing (ISP) group at the Universitat de ValÃ¨ncia develops machine learning and vision algorithms. We focus on methods able to extract knowledge from empirical data drawn by sensory (mostly imaging) systems. Our approach to signal, image, and vision processing combines statistical learning theory with the understanding of the underlying physics and biological vision.

Applications mainly focus on computational visual neuroscience, image processing, computer vision, remote sensing, and Earth and Climate sciences. The problems posed in these disciplines require similar mathematical tools, where model inversion, uncertainty estimation, and causal inference play a central role.
